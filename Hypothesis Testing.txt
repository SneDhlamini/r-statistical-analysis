Project Description

This project investigates whether the examination body written by South African matric candidates influences the likelihood of achieving a Bachelor pass.
Using a simulated dataset informed by real-world matric outcome patterns, statistical techniques were applied to compare Bachelor pass rates between candidates
who wrote the Independent Examinations Board (IEB) examinations and those who wrote the National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations. The analysis includes
descriptive statistics, visual comparisons, proportion tests, chi-squared tests, effect size estimation, subject stream  and logistic regression
modeling.

Hypotheses
Null Hypothesis:
There is no difference in the probability of achieving a Bachelor pass between candidates who write the IEB examinations and those who write the NSC examinations.
Alternative Hypothesis:
Candidates who write the IEB examinations are more likely to achieve a Bachelor pass than candidates who write the NSC examinations.

Conclusions
The results provide sufficient evidene to indicate that IEB candidates achieve higher Bachelor pass rates than NSC candidates. Proportion tests and chi-squared analysis
reveal a statistically significant association between examination body and Bachelor pass outcomes, with a non-negligible effect size. Logistic regression further 
confirms that, after controlling for subject stream, NSC candidates have significantly lower odds of obtaining a Bachelor pass compared to IEB candidates, while subject 
stream itself is not a significant predictor. Additionally, IEB candidates demonstrate higher distinction (80%+) rates across streams. Overall, the findings suggest that
systemic and structural differences between examination bodies play a more influential role in Bachelor pass outcomes than subject choice.
